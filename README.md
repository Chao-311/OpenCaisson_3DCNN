# OpenCaisson_3DCNN
The codes build a three-dimensional CNN (3D-CNN) model to predict the sinking speed of open caissons. By extracting the spatial-temporal characteristics of multivariate structural stress data, the model can accurately predict the sinking speed during the sinking process of open caissons.
